# Alice, Bob, and the Tale of Entwined Submarines

### Abstract

We propose an alternative architecture for white label exchange, which connects with Exchange Union daemon to facilitate
end-to-end trading of digital assets in trustless and decentralised manner.

### Pain points

The previous proposed architecture for white label exchange incorporates the tradeoff of trusting Xchange service providers,
for the usability benefit of users not having to run a full node or light client to be able to trade. This model requires Xchange
service providers to host a hot wallet for the funds of the users, which in turn escalates the security risks and raises the bar for normal
entrepreneurs to be a Xchange service provider. Furthermore, this architecture requires Xchanges to stake up XUC and also control XUC for the users in a hot wallet. This centralises the architecture and makes it hard to explore the utility of XUC for decentralised governance akin to the ZRX token in the [0x architecture](https://blog.0xproject.com/governance-in-0x-protocol-86779ae5809e). That model also doesn't work with on-chain wallets, ipso facto, pushing the prospect of widespread adoption further in future.

## Approach

Submarine Swaps let users send Lightning payments to a middleman on the Lightning Network; that middleman will send a corresponding amount of Bitcoin to a regular (on-chain) Bitcoin address. It also works the other way around: users can send regular on-chain payments to the middleman; that middleman will then send a corresponding amount of Bitcoin to a receiving Lightning node on the Lightning Network. A Submarine Swap has an on-chain side that can be on virtually any chain, so the altcoins donâ€™t need to have SegWit or a Lightning implementation for this to work. Go Doge! Although there is a middleman involved Submarine Swaps are completely trustless and can get refunded if the middleman is dishonest and tries to cheat.

Submarine swaps between on-chain LTC to off-chain BTC haven been successfully [tested](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1025168088595984384) recently by Alex Bosworth.

In conclusion Submarine Swaps allow users to swap funds on-chain to off-chain, off-chain to on-chain, and tangled together on-chain to on-chain. Users would not need a second layer wallet. Although Submarine Swaps can make any permutations of on-chain and off-chain swaps possible. We propose to utilise this novel technology to help us achieve our goal of connecting digital asset exchanges in Exchange Union ecosystem.

This picture depicts our proposed architecture:

Walli-server is a white label exchange (Xchange) that has a centralised matching engine order book, it is running a XUD full node and connecting to all other XUDs through it.

The picture below depicts one specific case of tangled subamarine swap that allows off-chain to on-chain exchange of assets. Consider a scenario where Alice is using walli, but she only has Ethereum in her off-chain wallet. She intends to buy 2000 XUC for her 1 ETH. Alice sends her 1 ETH to walli-server via her off-chain wallet. Walli-server puts on the order to exchange Alice's Ether for XUC via XUD instance. After a successful completion of an atomic swap, walli-server has 2000 XUC in it's second layer wallet which should be sent to Alice, but here's a catch - Alice doesn't have inbound channel balance or wants her XUC in the layer two walli wallet, so walli-server uses a submarine swap to transfer her XUC on-chain to her walli-vault - all this while maintaing the trustless-ness of the system. In the case of walli-server not being able to liquidate those 1 Ether, it initiates a refund. The business model made possible by this architecture is also pretty straightforward - walli-server is essentially a submarine swap provider and makes money via swap and routing fees. The problem of stale orders can be mitiagated by constant pruning of order book.

### Future work

Chains with high block times like BTC (10 minutes for 1 confirmation) make limit orders sent to walli-server via an on-chain wallet unbidden and require users to take the inevitable volatility into account. Under this model, BTC on-chain limit orders can only be delegated to walli-server via an off-chain Lightning wallet.

The XUC governance model is also easy to implement under this model. These are all high level ideas and need further exploration.
